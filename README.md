# SwitchKBMEmulator
A Windows Form Application that translates keyboard and mouse input into HORIPAD controller input for the Nintendo Switch.

This is a heavily modified clone of [this repo by wchill](https://github.com/wchill/SwitchInputEmulator) that mainly focuses on the Windows Form Application. Go to that repo for more details on how to compile and flash firmware onto a compatible microcontroller.

Or if you have a Arduino Pro Micro, I have provided a precompiled .hex for you to flash.

Hoping for someone to provide a firmware that emulates a joycon or pro controller for the gyro sensors. Until then, this project currently uses the control stick for mouse input.

Current WIP stages. Application has no instructions and is currently optimized for Splatoon gameplay.
