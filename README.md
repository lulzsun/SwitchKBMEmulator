# SwitchKBMEmulator Version 0.5.0
A Windows Form Application that translates keyboard and mouse input into HORIPAD controller input for the Nintendo Switch.

![Version 0.5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lulzsun/SwitchKBMEmulator/master/Resources/0_5.png)

This is a heavily modified clone of [this repo by wchill](https://github.com/wchill/SwitchInputEmulator) that mainly focuses on the Windows Form Application. Go to that repo for more details on how to compile and flash firmware onto a compatible microcontroller.

Or if you have a Arduino Pro Micro, I have provided a precompiled .hex for you to flash.

Hoping for someone to provide a firmware that emulates a joycon or pro controller for the gyro sensors. Until then, this project currently uses the control stick for mouse input.

#TO DO
* Use raw input instead of Windows.Forms.Input
* Optimize code
* Documentation
* Better UI
