# SwitchKBMEmulator
A Windows Form Application that translates keyboard and mouse input into HORIPAD controller input for the Nintendo Switch.

This is a heavily modified clone of [this repo by wchill](https://github.com/wchill/SwitchInputEmulator) that mainly focuses on the Windows Form Application. Go to that repo for more details on how to compile and flash firmware onto a compatible microcontroller.

Current WIP stages. Application has no instructions and is currently optimized for Splatoon gameplay.
